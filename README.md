![CI](https://github.com/webaid/jsutils/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

Must-have package for any javascript project.

## Installation

It's simple, you just have to install the package or include sources into your HTML.

### NPM

The most efficient way of installing the package is using the node package manager:

```bash
npm install @webaid/jsutils
```

### HTML

You also can download a compiled set of files and use them right from the HTML:

```
todo: compile, upload & reveal the sources URLs
```

## API

You can browse the sources in order to discover the functionality, all methods are well documented and have their own
tests that could work as an example.
